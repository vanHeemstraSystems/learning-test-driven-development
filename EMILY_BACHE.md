## Recommended Learning Path for Legacy Code with Python

1. **Start with:**

- Pluralsight course: “Unit Testing with Python 3”
- Book: “The Coding Dojo Handbook”

1. **Practice katas in order:**

- Tennis Kata (easiest - good test coverage already)
- Gilded Rose Kata (classic legacy code challenge)
- Parrot Kata (learn polymorphism refactoring)
- SupermarketReceipt Kata (complex business logic)

1. **Deep dive:**

- Book: “Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman Method”
- Book: “Mocks, Fakes and Stubs”
- Pluralsight course: “Testing in Python 3”

1. **Continuous practice:**

- Use [sammancoaching.org](http://sammancoaching.org) Learning Hour plans
- Watch Emily’s YouTube channel for demonstrations
- Try different katas from her GitHub repositories

## Key Techniques Emily Teaches for Legacy Code

Based on her resources, Emily emphasizes:

- **Characterization/Approval Testing** - Locking down current behavior before refactoring
- **The Sprout Technique** - Adding new, tested code alongside legacy code
- **Extract and Override** - Creating testable subclasses
- **Golden Master Testing** - Using TextTest for comprehensive approval testing
- **Small Steps Refactoring** - Making incremental, safe changes
- **Test Doubles** - Mocks, stubs, fakes, and spies for isolating dependencies
- **Coverage-Guided Testing** - Using pytest-cov to find untested paths

All of Emily’s resources are interconnected - the katas support the book concepts, the courses teach the techniques used in the katas, and the YouTube videos demonstrate everything in action. This makes for an extremely comprehensive learning ecosystem for mastering legacy code refactoring in Python!
